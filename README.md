# kauf_rgbww_config
Files needed in the ESPHome config directory to import a KAUF RGBWW bulb into your dashboard and keep basically all the stock KAUF functionality.

You need one yaml file per bulb, but only one per each of the other files total.  If you are importing multiple bulbs, download all the files of this repository into your ESPHome config directory.  Copy and paste the yaml file once per bulb.  Rename the yaml files to something descriptive for each bulb, and edit the yaml files where indicated in the comments.
